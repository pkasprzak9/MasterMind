# Mastermind

This repository contains a Ruby implementation of the popular code-breaking game called Mastermind. The game allows you to play as either the code breaker or the code maker.

## Classes

### Computer

The `Computer` class is responsible for generating a random 4-digit code that consists of numbers between 0 and 9. The code is stored in an instance variable called `@code`.

### Game

The `Game` class represents a Mastermind game and manages the gameplay logic. It takes instances of `Computer` and `Player` as parameters during initialization.

#### Public Methods

- `start_game`: This method starts the game and prompts the player to choose whether to guess or make the secret code. It then calls the respective private method based on the player's choice.

#### Private Methods

- `play_as_codebreaker`: This method starts a game where the player has to guess a secret code generated by the computer within 12 rounds. It outputs the result of the game (win or lose) at the end.
- `play_round_cb`: This method plays a single round as the code breaker, where the player guesses the secret code. It compares the player's guess with the computer's code and provides feedback on the correctness of the guess.
- `play_as_codemaker`: This method starts a game where the player has to create a secret code, and the computer tries to guess it within 12 rounds. It outputs the result of the game (win or lose) at the end.
- `play_round_cm`: This method plays a single round as the code maker, where the computer guesses the player's secret code. It compares the computer's guess with the player's code and provides feedback on the correctness of the guess.
- `compare_codes`: This method compares two codes (secret code and guess code) and returns the count of digits in the correct position and the count of digits in the incorrect position.

### Player

The `Player` class represents the player in the game. It allows the player to generate a code by entering four digits. The digits are stored in an instance variable called `@code`.

#### Public Methods

- `generate_code`: This method prompts the player to enter four digits and stores them as the player's guess.

## To-Do List

-  Implement an improved code analysis algorithm in the `Computer` class to analyze feedback and make better guesses in subsequent rounds.
-  Enhance the guessing strategy of the `Computer` class to optimize the chances of cracking the secret code within 12 rounds.
-  Refactor the code to improve readability, maintainability, and adherence to Ruby best practices.
-  Add unit tests to ensure the correctness of the implemented classes and methods.
-  Implement a user-friendly command-line interface with clear instructions and error handling.
-  Consider adding additional game modes or difficulty levels to provide more gameplay options.
-  Update the README file with detailed instructions on how to use and customize the game.

Feel free to contribute to the repository by tackling any of the items on the to-do list. Pull requests are welcome!
